        <h2>POC with a new Stack</h2>
<p class="meta">18 May 2010</p>

<div id="post">
<p>So I started working with <a href="http://trevershick.livejournal.com/6571.html">Grails on a POC</a> for pulling together multiple micro-web services into a common service platform offering for all of our web apps.Â  Each of the micro-web services were going to be implemented in Grails, Java, Ruby or whatever is appropriate.Â  In using Grails and trying to deploy multiple grails app into Eclipse&#8217;s WST I basically ran into issues (couldn&#8217;t do it - could only find <a href="http://www.grails.org/STS+Integration">this article</a>) and decided that it was more important to finish the POC and the actual technology was not so important.Â  I&#8217;m just about done with the POC but I thought i&#8217;d note the stack and add some notes.</p>
<p>So, for a webapp framework i&#8217;m using <a href="http://click.apache.org/">Apache Click</a>. I&#8217;m really loving this model over non component-based web frameworks.Â  I used to do a lot of Swing work, and the Apache Click model &#8216;feels&#8217; comfortable.Â  I&#8217;m <a href="http://click.apache.org/docs/faq.html#spring-integration">using Spring with Click</a> as well.Â  It feels OK and seems to integrate easily and our shop is a Spring shop so I have to ensure the framework would work well with Spring.</p>
<p>A big departure for me was the move away from a traditional RDBMS to Mongo DB.Â  During the initial coding of the POC I was using all in-memory implementation of my services; this allowed me to code without worrying about any of the persistenceÂ  logic.Â  Once I decided I needed to code the persistence side, I really couldn&#8217;t bring myself to write yet another JDBC DAO and I didn&#8217;t feel like using Hibernate.Â  I thought about Data Nucleus but that requires an extra compilation step I really didn&#8217;t feel like messing with (it didn&#8217;t move the POC forward, it was just something else to learn that I may throw away).Â  With all the NoSQL hulabaloo, I figured i&#8217;d give MongoDB a try. It has a large production base and seems to have good driver support. It&#8217;s also very easy to use.Â  The POC I was working on was perfect for MongoDB, it didn&#8217;t have a high write-rate but did have a high read rate.Â  It is also fine for the eventually consistent aspect of MongoDB.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have to write something up on how I used MongoDB. I used it&#8217;s most rudimentary features, but I was able to replace the in-memory implementation of my services with Mongo DB backed implementations in minutes (literally).Â  The most time consuming aspect of using Mongo DB was the marshalling of objects to&lt;&gt;from Java objects.Â  There appear to be some ORM like tools out there for MongoDB but I chose not to use them because A) I didn&#8217;t want to waste time learning another framework I may throw away, and B) I wanted to learn lower level Mongo DB APIs.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the POC is proceeding. I&#8217;ll post some screenshots and diagrams once it&#8217;s complete.</p>
