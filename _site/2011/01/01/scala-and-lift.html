        <h2>Scala and Lift</h2>
<p class="meta">01 Jan 2011</p>

<div id="post">
<p>I&#8217;ve started learning Scala and Lift together today.  I&#8217;ve briefly looked at it prior to today but I haven&#8217;t really dug in until today.  My first major hurdle is Eclipse.  I&#8217;ve had numerous issues getting Scala IDE and Lift working with Maven and essentially i&#8217;ve given up.  I switched to IntelliJ IDEA and it&#8217;s been great.</p>

<p>Conceptually it&#8217;s a big leap to move to a functional programming language.  Yeah, it&#8217;s an OO / FP blend and you can move slowly over to FP but I feel that I&#8217;d rather make the plunge instead of just sticking my toe in.  I&#8217;m working on a proof of concept that could really benefit from some Ajaxy portlets (not really portlets, but similar) which is the reason I&#8217;m trying Lift.  The demonstrations of their Comet capabilities and the simple Ajax code is fairly compelling.</p>

<p>I love Python/Django and i&#8217;ve suffered with Java for many years, so part of me just wants to try something new.  But instead of switching to OCaml or Haskell I figured i could gain the benefits of the FP language and the strong ajax support as well as reuse many of my java skills that i already have.</p>

<p>Anyhow, this is really just a kick off. I&#8217;ll try to post when I come across something compelling or notable.</p>
