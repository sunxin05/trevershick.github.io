<p>The admin application in django rocks.  I need something like that in Java. Don't say 'grails'. Not a big fan. I think i'd rather deploy django in Jython at this point (which i will try).  The speed with which i can pull stuff together in django is pretty nice.    I need to look into leveraging existing Java libraries with Django in Jython.</p>
