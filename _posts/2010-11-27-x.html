<p>The admin application in django rocks.  I need something like that in Java. Don&#8217;t say &#8216;grails&#8217;. Not a big fan. I think i&#8217;d rather deploy django in Jython at this point (which i will try).  The speed with which i can pull stuff together in django is pretty nice.    I need to look into leveraging existing Java libraries with Django in Jython.</p>
