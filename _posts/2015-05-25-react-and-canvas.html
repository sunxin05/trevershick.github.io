<p>
A challenge was posed to me... Can we highlight dependencies between items in an HTML grid easily?  I initially thought it was an untenable problem but it turned out to be very easy.

<p>
The basic strategy was to overlay a canvas over the top of a component we had already built, then utilizing <code>getBoundingClientRect</code> and canvas primitives, draw the arrows.  Below is my fiddle.  It took a few hours, but was well worth it.  I even added some adaptive behavior when the grid expands/contracts to keep the arrows from getting too crowded.  If you shrink or grow the example you'll see some arrows switching which 'port' it points to.
