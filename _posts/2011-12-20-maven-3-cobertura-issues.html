<p>
So, one of our developers was seeing some odd results in his Jenkins cobertura reports.


The tests weren't changing, but the coverage numbers were fluctuating.

Reviewing the logs, I found a common issue (shown below).

<h1>Results</h1>
<p>Instead of typing up everything I tried over the last couple of days, i'll just put down basic notes&#160;:</p>

<ul><li>Maven&#160;: v 3.0.3 (and up)</li>
<li><b>Cobertura Maven Plugin&#160;: 2.4 - fixes the issue</b></li>
<li>Cobertura Maven Plugin&#160;: 2.3 - doesn't work (has issues shown in log above)</li>
<li>Cobertura Maven Plugin&#160;: 2.51 - doesn't work (has classloader MavenReport issues)</li>
<li>-Dcobertura.use.java.nio=false - Unnecessary (in my case)</li>
</ul>
