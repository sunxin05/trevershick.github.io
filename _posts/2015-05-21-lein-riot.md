I recently started using Riot JS on a home project built with Clojure
and got tired of running the riot compiler manually. So I built [lein-riot](https://github.com/trevershick/lein-riot).

It's easy enough, just add it to your `project.clj` file and run `lein riot`.


{%highlight clojure %}
  :riot { :tags [["resources/public/" "resources/public/seisei-tags.js"]]}
{%endhighlight%}


## Invoking Riot

{%highlight bash %}
$ lein riot        # Runs the Riot Compiler
$ lein riot watch  # Runs Riot in watch mode on the FIRST tag set you've specified
$ lein riot help   # Shows Help
{%endhighlight%}
