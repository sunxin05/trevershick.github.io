title: POC with a new Stack

<p>So I started working with <a href="http://trevershick.livejournal.com/6571.html">Grails on a POC</a> for pulling together multiple micro-web services into a common service platform offering for all of our web apps.
	  Each of the micro-web services were going to be implemented in Grails, Java, Ruby or whatever is appropriate.
	  In using Grails and trying to deploy multiple grails app into Eclipse's WST I basically ran into issues (couldn't do it - could only find <a href="http://www.grails.org/STS+Integration">this article</a>) and decided that it was more important to finish the POC and the actual technology was not so important.
	  I'm just about done with the POC but I thought i'd note the stack and add some notes.</p>
<p>So, for a webapp framework i'm using <a href="http://click.apache.org/">Apache Click</a>. I'm really loving this model over non component-based web frameworks.
	  I used to do a lot of Swing work, and the Apache Click model 'feels' comfortable.
	  I'm <a href="http://click.apache.org/docs/faq.html#spring-integration">using Spring with Click</a> as well.
	  It feels OK and seems to integrate easily and our shop is a Spring shop so I have to ensure the framework would work well with Spring.</p>
<p>A big departure for me was the move away from a traditional RDBMS to Mongo DB.
	  During the initial coding of the POC I was using all in-memory implementation of my services; this allowed me to code without worrying about any of the persistence
	  logic.
	  Once I decided I needed to code the persistence side, I really couldn't bring myself to write yet another JDBC DAO and I didn't feel like using Hibernate.
	  I thought about Data Nucleus but that requires an extra compilation step I really didn't feel like messing with (it didn't move the POC forward, it was just something else to learn that I may throw away).
	  With all the NoSQL hulabaloo, I figured i'd give MongoDB a try. It has a large production base and seems to have good driver support. It's also very easy to use.
	  The POC I was working on was perfect for MongoDB, it didn't have a high write-rate but did have a high read rate.
	  It is also fine for the eventually consistent aspect of MongoDB.</p>
<p>I'll have to write something up on how I used MongoDB. I used it's most rudimentary features, but I was able to replace the in-memory implementation of my services with Mongo DB backed implementations in minutes (literally).
	  The most time consuming aspect of using Mongo DB was the marshalling of objects to&lt;&gt;from Java objects.
	  There appear to be some ORM like tools out there for MongoDB but I chose not to use them because A) I didn't want to waste time learning another framework I may throw away, and B) I wanted to learn lower level Mongo DB APIs.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the POC is proceeding. I'll post some screenshots and diagrams once it's complete.</p>
