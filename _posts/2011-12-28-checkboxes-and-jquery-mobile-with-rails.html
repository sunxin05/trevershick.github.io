<p>I've been playing with JQuery Mobile and Rails and I had a problem with a checkbox not working properly.  The checkbox would render properly but wouldn't update my model. My checkbox was rendered within the erb template with the following snippet&#8230;</p>

{%highlight erb%}
<p><code><br/>
<div data-role="fieldcontain">
 	<fieldset data-role="controlgroup">
		<%= f.label :interviewer %>
		<%= f.check_box :interviewer %>
    </fieldset><br/>
</div><br/></code></p>
{%endhighlight%}

<p>It turns out i had the label and checkbox in the incorrect order.</p>

{%highlight erb%}
<div data-role="fieldcontain">
 	<fieldset data-role="controlgroup">
		<%= f.check_box :interviewer %>
		<%= f.label :interviewer %>
    </fieldset>
</div>
{%endhighlight%}

Why, I haven't bothered to figure it out, but it's working now and as i didn't find anything on google about this problem, i'm posting this entry.</p>
