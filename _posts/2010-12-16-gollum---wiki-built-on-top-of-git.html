<a href="https://github.com/github/gollum/blob/master/README.md">Gollum - Wiki built on top of git</a><br/><p>I started using the github wiki today and while i thought it was OK, it wasn't until i realized i could download it and modify it all locally that i began to believe it was awesome.</p>
<p>Gollum is the Ruby software that github uses as it's wiki system. Â It's not 'immensely' powerful at this point but the fact that I can manage my wiki contents just like a regular git repository is extremely useful. Â </p>
<p>Also, since gollum is just ruby and runs in Sinatra, I am able to run gollum locally on top of my local git repository clone of my real wiki to do full preview before 'pushing' the wiki changes to github. Pure awesomeness.</p>
<p>I've been wanting to do something like that at work. Â We use confluence as a wiki and I would love to see it be our external documentation site. However, doing a mass upload of wiki documentation (like branching and merging/etc..) is not something confluence supports. Â If confluence were built on top of subversion or git, then I'd be able to sell it easier to our documentation folks&#8230; Â </p>
<p>For the time being however i'm just going to enjoy working with it on my github projects.</p>
