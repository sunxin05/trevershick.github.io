<p><a href="https://github.com/tonsky/datascript">Datascript</a> has really interested me as of late.
I have not done much extensive work with it, but the prospect of its use within a rapid
prototyping environment seems promising.
</p>

<p>Effectively, it's a Datomic like client side database implemented in ClojureScript with regular JavaScript bindings.  The JSFiddle below uses datascript as a local datastore and loads it with data. Then using datalog, it builds up the data series chart configuration required by Highcharts.</p>

<p>The interesting thing to me is having a generalized data store.  I'm unconcerned with where i get data and its shape, i simply map it all into datascript and use the query language to pull out exactly what I need.</p>

<p>
For example, converting bytes to MB and obtaining the min/max/avg values is very easy.

{%highlight clojurescript%}
[ :find (avg ?dataSize) (max ?dataSize) (min ?dataSize)
  :where
  [ ?e "dataSize" ?ds ]
  [(/ ?ds 1048576) ?dataSize]]
{%endhighlight%}
