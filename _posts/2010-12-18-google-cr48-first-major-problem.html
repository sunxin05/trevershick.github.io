title: Google cr48 First Major Problem

tags: 
---
<p>Well, after the first day I haven't had many software problems. Â A couple of minor app problems and one browser crash but those are pretty minor. My largest issue for today is an annoying 'p' key which doesn't want to work correctly. It works, but the action is not as clean as the rest of the buttons on the keyboard. Â It's a true annoyance. Â I've reported the issue but as I didn't pay for the laptop i'm assuming it wont' be replaced.</p>
<p>Other than that, i'm still trying to figure out a viable workflow for coding on this thing. Â I have java and django work to do but i'm really not able to code on this. Since there's no local environment the most i've been able to do is thoughtwork and documentation, which of course is imortant. Â (damned p key again)</p>
<p>Kodinger (sp?) looks interesting but the login doesn't seem to be working at this point. Â The only other way at this point is to ssh over to my mac and do some editing there. However, vi will only get you so far and starting up tomcat in debug mode ain't gonna cut it. Â I'll work something out.</p>
