I've really come to love Korean soups.  They're especially nice on a cold day, but for lunches (I work from home) they are fantastic.  I can throw together a fresh soup with lots of vegetables and it's always tasty.  At any rate I threw together a soup yesterday that ended up being VERY tasty.  I don't have a name for it. I did however write down the recipe so I could reproduce it.

## Vocab

* baechu kimchi : [cabbage kimchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimchi)
* shishito : [korean peppers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shishito)
* tteok : [rice cake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tteok)
* ssamjang : [a spicy paste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssamjang)
* doenjang : [soy bean paste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doenjang);

## Recipe

In a sauce pan add -

* One cup of cabbage kimchi (baechu kimchi)
* A handful of dried shiitake mushrooms
* Two green onions - cut up the green part in bite-size chunks, cut up the white part thing slices.  I've found kitchen scissors work great for this.
* Shishito peppers - cut up into 1-2mm slices, keep the seeds
* One can of beef broth
* A handful of [rice cake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tteok). I use the thinly sliced ones for soup.
* 3 tablespoons of [ssamjang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssamjang)
* 1 tablespoon of regular [deonjang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doenjang)
* 1 cup of water
Bring to a boil for 5 to 10 minutes then simmer for another 10.

Then add ...

* One egg

...and mix until the egg is cooked.  You want to stir the egg throughout the soup.  Don't leave the egg intact, you want it to thicken the soup.


Enjoy.
