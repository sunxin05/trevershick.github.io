<p>I&#8217;ve created a custom auth scheme and finally got it deployed.  It took a while. I finally got to the point where i created a log() method that logs to /tmp/{classname}.log. This is not a long term solution, but it&#8217;s helping me during the discovery phase.  I instantiated the FileWriter in the init method and then logged to it in the query() method but I was getting errors like&#160;: 

[30651/4042537872][Wed Jul 06&#160;2011&#160;07:28:18][SmAuthServer.cpp:233][ERROR] Failed to query authentication scheme &#8216;AlwaysAcceptCredentialsFormAuthScheme&#8217;

Ultimately, I changed the log() method to do lazy initialization of the file writer and BAM! i started getting log messages.  The funny thing is, i NEVER get the init() log message.  I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s being called.  Their documentation says it will be called once for each instance of the custom authentication scheme but i&#8217;m never seeing it called, so i&#8217;m very confused.

<pre><code> 
public SmAuthStatus init(String parameter, String secret) {
  log("init() called on " +getClass().getName() + " with " 
    + secret+ " and " + parameter);
  return SmAuthStatus.SMAUTH_SUCCESS;
}
</code></pre>

I&#8217;ll see if I can figure it out.

<b>Update 2011-07-08</b> - init() is in fact called.  I noticed in my logs that it is being called now. I do not know what changed as I&#8217;ve had many changes.  I simply was not relying on init() being called so i never noticed when it started.</p>
