<p>So, search.maven.org is a great site, but i don't want to bring up a browser just to find artifacts.  In an effort to bone-up on my groovy I thought i'd create a groovy script that would search for me.</p>

<p>Feel free to use this script, and if you can improve it, fork it and make ur own changes.</p>
