<p>Up until yesterday, i had not found a good way to test my LDAP client code besides manually testing it, which is simply unacceptable from my standpoint.</p>

<p>But thanks to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7269697/embedded-memory-ldap-server-solution/7274215">this stack overflow anwer</a> I was lead to the Unboundid LDAP SDK.  </p>

<p>After playing around writing tests with it, I quickly refactored my test code into an annotation based test utility that allows me to easily start up the server and seed it with information.  I've put the code on <a href="https://github.com/trevershick/ldap-test-utils">Github</a>.</p>

<p><b>Update</b> 2013-06-08 - ldap-test-utils is in Maven Central.</p>
