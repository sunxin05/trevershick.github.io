title: SmartLifecycle Spring 3.0 Autostart Bug

---
<p><h1>The Problem</h1>
I was working on a poc the other day using Zookeeper, Netflix's Curator library and Spring MDPs.  I wanted to start a single mdp in a cluster at a time.  In order to do this I needed a bean to manage the starting and stopping of the DefaultMessageListenerContainer.  In doing this, I founf that there's a bug in the DefaultLifecycleProcessor in spring 3.0.  

<h1>The scenario</h1>

Bean A and B are both SmartLifecycle implementations.  Bean A controls Bean B by calling its start() and stop() methods.  The configuration calls for Bean A to autostart but NOT Bean B.  The *bug* is that in this scenario in Spring 3.0 both A and B will be started based on Bean A's autoStartup property.

<h1>The Rub</h1>
i reported this bug but it won't be fixed in 3.0.  It is fixed in 3.1 but our company won't be on 3.1 for a while.  

<h1>The Workaround</h1>

Ultimately I changed the implementation so that Bean A looks up Bean B by *name*.  This essentially hides the declarative dependency on Bean B and thus the default lifecycle processor doesn'
*Therein lies the problem*
t start bean B.</p>
